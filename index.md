I made it. Again. After, maybe, 10 years.

And again I have the same mood here, I think. I'm home alone, listening blues.

Here is a link to a note I made last evening about
[resizing ext4 partition of a guest Ubuntu on vmdk on ESXi 6.0](https://superuser.com/a/1594385/1230369).
I spent some time finding out how to atually resize the disk and wrote down
the steps to remember, and now I have mine **aleksandr.vin**
domain name and a site running on github pages.
