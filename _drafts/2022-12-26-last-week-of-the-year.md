Having last week as obligatory vacation I'm finishing some chores at home.

## Shadow on Raspberry pi

Yep, somehow my pi was running a 32 bit OS. Attempt to install Shadow uncovered
that problem. And now it sounds like a good moment to refresh what I'm running
there:

- [ ] avahi — mDNS for service discovery
- [ ] netatalk — an AFP fileserver
- [ ] minidlna — to stream videos in LAN
- [ ] transmission — a daemon with web UI
- [ ] prometheus
- [ ] node_exporter
- [ ] [mijn-simpel-exporter](https://github.com/aleksandr-vin/mijn-simpel-exporter)
- [ ] grafana
- [ ] homebridge

And actually install Shadow client there at the end.
