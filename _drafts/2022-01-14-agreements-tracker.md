With GDPR all sites started asking for your consent (and they use cookies). Good that they asked.
But, this way you don't even read what's there that they are asking. You just click *Agree* or
*Agree to basic* or whatever is preselected.
  
So at the end of the day/week – when you reflex on what was there – there would be awesome to have
a report of things you did agree.

The thing can run in background as a browser extension and detect interaction on pages: what they
ask for, what were the options and what did you deside. Plus the time it took for you to deside,
did you read the options and so on.
