Listening & watching youtube on 12 bar blues, first [how to keep the count](https://youtu.be/qjCblIQabfc) and,
then while practicing it and watching on 3 lines by four measures I started seeing that first 3x3 is a diagonal
matrix that is "horizontally mirrored". And the last measure of each line is a vector. Is it a hidden MxA math?

```
\begin{pmatrix}
  G7 & G7 & G7\\
  C7 & C7 & G7\\
  D7 & C7 & G7
\end{pmatrix}
\times
\begin{pmatrix}
  G7\\ 
  G7\\
  G7
\end{pmatrix}
```
