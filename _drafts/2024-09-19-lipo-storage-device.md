After watching this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeMqvQHnj2c

I've got an idea that I need to put LIPOs to storage volts ASAP after the session and then just charge them right before
the next session. Probably from a big-capacity LIPO that I have (like 4400mAh 4S).

And then I've got another idea of a device that you plug all your LIPOs (4-6 packs for ex.) after a session and they are
balanced to a storage volts. Probably by moving charge from those that are higher than storage to those that are lower,
and probably not even needing a separate power source.

Then 30 min before flight session, I'm plugging all session lipos into that device (in a case), taking it into the car
and hitting the road to a spot. And after the session I plug them again and ride home.
