During a call with a new colleague, while discussing thoughts on a tool that can be a dictionary of acronyms, I've got an idea of
making an _Acronym of the day_ service.

People can subscribe to it and get an email every morning with one acronym being explained. That can be work-related acronyms, like
the ones in aviation industry.

Thinking about the implementation: to have it running internally, it can be set up as a Bamboo scheduled build that send emails to
all subscribers.

It should be a community-maintained service: people can register new acronyms (should be with as little friction as possible) and
people can edit the explanation and provide links for more info. The engine can be Wiki.
