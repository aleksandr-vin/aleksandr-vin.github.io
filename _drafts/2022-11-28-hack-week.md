My plan for the week is to setup some sort of a system to track/trace
the transformations we do with big data.

1. We are fetching flights info over some days from HBase
2. There are some filters in that scan already
3. We normalise some column's values
4. We abstract some data, by using one fields' values when some
   logic is true
5. We group and filter that data
6. We fetch PAX for the flights from HBase again
7. Again filtering
8. And again grouping and transforming
9. Then we count the groups
10. And store end result numbers

When we show these numbers to the user and he has questions about it,
then a developer need to sit and debug/trace what was used as a source
for calculations of that numbers.

The idea is to store the traces of all the calculations we do and
have it at hand if the user needs. Then query it with GraphQL and show
on UI.

## Step 1 -- Enumerating the cases

All our updaters are:

1. `ScheduleUpdater`
2. `DisruptionUpdater`
3. `RestrictionsUpdater`
4. `KpiUpdater`
5. `PaxFlowUpdater`
6. `MisconnectionsUpdater`
7. `SlotSeriesUpdater`
8. `CargoUpdater`

We can keep these:

1. `ScheduleUpdater` -- looks simple to load and filter, but appears very cumbersome to resolve (combines with changes stored in DB)
2. `DisruptionUpdater`
3. `RestrictionsUpdater`
4. `PaxFlowUpdater`
5. `MisconnectionsUpdater`
6. `SlotSeriesUpdater`
7. `CargoUpdater`

### Ideas

1. Monadic type `TZIO[R,E,A,T]` with trace `T`
2. Save each flatMap result to a typed cache under hashid of result
3. Save each flatMap's input in cache too to allow back-traverrsing history
4. Extend current graphql queries' types with introspection-style resolvers that resolve type+hashid into cached result,
   that should be lazy-resolvable
5. Caching can be with small ttl by default and extending ttl x2 with every resolver's call (or m.b. not 2x for every call, but to some cold storage with mutation to remove it)
6. Alternatively that initial caching can be skipped by default and done on demand (for next updater's run after graphql query, which can synchronously wait or smth. alike)
