Started watching a course.

Link TBD.

Note: same day a [podcast episode about Hugging Face went online](https://syntax.fm/show/740/local-ai-models-in-javascript-machine-learning-deep-dive-with-xenova) on Syntax :)

**UPDATE:** /rewatched DUNE/ and saw an announcement of Command-R from Cohere,... while *downloading model-00011-of-00015.safetensors* decided to
read what is RAG,... and read on nVidia site [(archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240303213825/https%253A//blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/) that the guy, who coined the term *RAG* -- Lewis, *who now leads a RAG team at AI startup Cohere.* :)
