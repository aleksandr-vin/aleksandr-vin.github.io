* Run into an idea of a killer-feature for ImmersedVR

  This is how I proposed it on the Discord, https://discord.com/channels/428916969283125268/430876006216368139/830120758725705789:

  Heh, who is aware of WebXR? It would be nice (and I can bet that eventually it will be done anyway) to have integrated support of it in immersedVR. In simple
  words: You open a webxr-enabled site on a browser on your computer while working though immersedVR session, click Enter VR button on that page and Voila!: you
  are in that 3D scene!!! You can choose to keep virtual screens visible as an overlay or not. When you're ready to leave that scene, simply click on the Leave
  button that is added on your wrist band menu. That would be f***n killer experience.

  Check the samples, if you hear WebXR for the very first time: https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/ â€“ check them from the Oculus Quest 2 integrated
  browser (for now :wink: )
