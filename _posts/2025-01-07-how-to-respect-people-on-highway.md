title: "How To Respect People On Highways"

I hear from others that I love people, that I'm kind and care for others. Why I find myself then
hating others on the highway?

There is kind of bipolarity in me: I know, I can't be better driver then others, on one side.
But on the other, same time, I feel I drive better, than most there.

I don't see public roads as a circuit, so no chasing or driving relentlessly. There is nothing
to win and no loosers or winners or even qualification order at the end. People just go from
A to B for their differnet business, each different and all so common.

I know that inaccurancies and illogic can drive me nuts. And I'm not an agressive person, more
like a big whale or elephant: if you know me, I probably decide and act slowly,... and silently.

Then why it is such a thing on a highway?

Could it be a matter of me spending more time focused on one thing: I need to "watch" this
movie during the whole show that I'm driving through. I listen to the music while driving, can
talk with passenger, but if I need to actively solve something or explain -- I'll start getting
less grip on the focus on the road.

And it is not only "others against me" situation: I see how other drivers act on the road, not
affecting me, but others, and that bothers me too.

I am thinking, what humanity expects to become better in life, is to stop hating eachother on
the road.
