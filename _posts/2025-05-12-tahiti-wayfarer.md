I am afraid of myself, sometimes.

Over the last weekend I am screwing into the catamarans thing.
Friday was no-no, and Sunday I'm in love. I'll leave the name here:
Mara Noka. It appeared to be a solid design by James Wharram, the
one you cross Oceans and the one you fall in love the more you learn.

That's a sailing as it was in the roots. Moana movie vibes of
explorers and advantureres...

Now it's Monday, I hear guitar strings from my monitors and my soul
is dreaming of building a catamaran. How painful it is to think
of how to build a Tiki 38 or similar in size for the family sailing. 2000-2500 man hours... And how to convince my homies.

Should I start with a Tahiti Wayfarer for local seas and fun during
summer: spending 2 weeks on islands on our self-build catamaran? :-}

Call me crazy.
