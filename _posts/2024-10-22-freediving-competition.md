About a week ago, -- 14-10-2024 -- I did complete a PADI Freediving course with ABC Dive. It took 3 weeks
and 3 lessons: STA, DYN and FIM+CWT. I am enjoying it as much as I can. Last lesson was at Dive4life, in
Germany. That's a 20m pool with a lot of POI's there. I made it to 15m without any problems and with
calmness and ease, and had no anxiety or fear. Only by the safety exercise I was a little-bit in a rush,
cause I felt I was late with dive as a buddy, and equalized too hard, which ended up with blood from my
nose.

Anyway I performed the rescue exercise completely and did got a certification, but was not able to go
deeper than 5 (and later 3) meters after that, and did not make photos at depth.

It was very exciting to watch

knowing how things rolling there. It's just a lot to watch: at the time of writing I only watched 2hrs
from 5:36hrs of first day, but it's good to watch part-by-part.

And last Sunday, -- 20-10-2024 -- I watched
[AIDA Pool Competition Almere 2024](https://www.abcdive.nl/aida-pool-competition-almere-2024-visitor/),
which does not look like a normal competition, but just calm and relaxed time spending in pool with
friends. And the idea to compete in the next one hit me hard. It will happen in Badhoevedorp on 27-11-2024,
Wednesday evening.

I am now thinking about the training calendar and how to prepare for the hassle of the new place, new people
and competition mode. Saturday before last lesson I improved my PB to 5:44, which is mind blowing for
everyone who knows me and for myself as well, but that let me thinking about the competition more seriously.

Last night had all my mind around the competition. Here's what I think:

1. I need to check in the water, how stable I am at reaching PB time (planning to do that with buddy in the
   upcoming Friday's training sessions)

2. I need to improve my fins technique: I don't believe I'll buy FR finns for the competition, but I can
   ask guys on Fridays to see my technique and give suggestions

3. I need to start using nose-clip: as feeling water on my face can improve mammal reflex and low the HR.
   I am wondering will I need goggles for STA or I can go with open face?

4. Also need neck weight and belt with weights for DYN.

5. Need to start running and exercising, but not heavily, as it can lead to muscle recovery, which can take
   tax on the O2 use.
  
6. Need to make a calendar and do yoga and pranayama everyday.

7. Start swiming in the pool on Thrusdays.

8. And measure everything and keep training log.
