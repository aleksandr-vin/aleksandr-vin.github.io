Today was another awesome lesson with Delbert. Was playing chord progression of Everywhere Calypso by Sonny Rollins:

    D-G-A7-D
    B7-Em7-A-D

Love it. Started with chords, then made an etude, then added approach to 3rds and finished with broken chords and a bit more, this pattern, i.e.:

    F#-G-F#-D-A

Need to make my etude for next time. Was allowed to use no more than 2 half-notes for 4 lines.
