Got a flat-iron steak from Sligro on 30th of Dec. Cooked it in the oven on 6th of Jan. Need to repeat.

## The recipe

1. Remove from the fridge 1h before cooking to let it warm.

2. Dry it with paper towels and generously salt both sides.

3. Preheat oven in grill mode to 260ºC.

4. Use ribbed pan with holes to let water dip out.

5. Oil steak with olive oil, both sides before bringing it into the oven.

6. Put steak on the pan, add rosemarin, no cooking paper: it will burn out and will keep water under the steak.

7. Load on the top floor in the oven, 6 min per side.

8. Put it out on the cutting board and cover it loosely with foil tent.

9. Cut slices before serving.


## Mistakes

To be removed on repeat.

1. Cooking paper collect water and boils the steak

2. 260ºC could be less than desired to make grill marks: try 300ºC

3. Use pan with holes to let the water dip out
