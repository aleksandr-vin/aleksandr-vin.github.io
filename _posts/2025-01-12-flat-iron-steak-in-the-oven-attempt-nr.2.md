Second attempt with flat-iron steak from Sligro in the oven on 6th of Jan. Need to repeat.

## The recipe

See [previous post](/2025/01/06/flat-iron-steak-in-the-oven.html).

## New Mistakes

To be removed on next attempt.

1. Proper time each side: I mistakenly timed 12 min for first side, which should be 6 min per side!
