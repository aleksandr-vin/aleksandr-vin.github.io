I've watched a movie by David Attenborough, about the Ocean. It's a fresh one and more optimistic than _Seaspiracy_,
which I've watched [around a month ago](/2025/03/31/diet-change.html).

**Terror**ific frames of trawling are giving a vomitting feeling.

David said about the UN Ocean Conference, which will happen 9-13 June 2025 in Nice, France. Where one of the main topic will be the SDG-14 or _Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development_.

That triggered me to do some research on the upcoming conference. I've put it in my calendar and will try to follow the live stream
on [UN Web TV](https://webtv.un.org/).

It's interesting how much of the events are happenning inside the
UN and I am wondering (again) how all this organisation works. For
example right now it is broadcasting live a _Outer Space:
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Legal Subcommittee,
64th session, 1082nd meeting_ -- a lot of countries'
representatives are reading their letters about the topic, and it
does look like a long meeting with all the general traits, like
tired people who are not so good on listenning of what others are
saying, they just announce their prepared message and then the
next continues. If you look at the faces of others, who do not speak
now, they are just waiting for their turn. And those who speak,
or actually read, they just focused on reading the paper, not even
interacting, or even checking if the audience is following them.
That's why my question: how does these meetings produce a result?

So, waiting now for the 9th of June and will see it live.
