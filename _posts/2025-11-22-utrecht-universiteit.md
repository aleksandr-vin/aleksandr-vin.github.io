I'm in Utrecht today. Kid is checking the university during open dag. She is on the *arts geschiedenis*,
where the auditorium is not so big, so parents are asked to wait outside. I got coffee — nice tip, noted
by O in the morning, to bring your own cup — and now sitting in the corner with my macbook and doing
some chores around the homelab. VPN is on, working and ... I hear two dutch girls chatting in the other
side of the room. They are not aware of me sitting silently downstairs. I don't follow what they are
talking about, I just suddenly realize that I enjoy their voice and the language. And I realise that this
is one of the things I like here, in the Netherlands: dutch girls speaking. I'm so fond of this
enlightment, that I decided to write it down here. And I like Utrecht, it's different to Amsterdam and it
is full of students. The correlion is playing non-stop today. I wish I can be a student here.
