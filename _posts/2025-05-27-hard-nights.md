While I'm preparing a building site in my garden, I've finished all the articles, provided
with Tiki 21 study plans. And suddenly after that, I got an idea: "Maybe it's better to
build a Tiki 26?". It's more ocean-capable, has 4 berths, one can sit inside. Then, while
sleeping I was busy thinking how I would bring hulls from the build site, as they will be
not 90 kilos but 190 then. I even checked the specs for telescoping machine cranes that night.

In the morning I saw that epoxy will be 2.5x more. Hard choice.

During the day I was inclined back to 21, as a first build (my kid said, that we'll build it
and later sell it and build a bigger one!).

And just before going to bed, I stepped into an idea of why not building a Narai Mk IV: the
classic one with big flat space on top. I like it! Why wasting time on smaller Tiki, when
I can start building the good classic family ocean cruiser in a proper build site from the
beginning. With that thought I went to sleep. Poor me.

Next day morning, I am checking the est. materials costs (updated for 2020 on [wharram site](https://www.wharram.com/articles/choosing-a-boat)):
Narai Mk IV is almost 10x higher than Tiki 21. Looks like I'll be building Tiki first. And
start saving for Narai.
