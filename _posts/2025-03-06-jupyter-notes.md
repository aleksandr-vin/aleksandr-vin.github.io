Coming back to ML and JupyterLab notebooks. Some notes.

## Installation / Run (Quick)

Running in docker is a cleanest way. Use this script [/scripts/jupyter.sh] or:

```shell
curl -sL https://aleksandr.vin/scripts/jupyter.sh | bash
```

To run a docker container [**jupyter/pytorch-notebook**](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) with JupyterLabs locally. Token will be `hello+there`.
