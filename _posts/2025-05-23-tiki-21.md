## Plan

This is the plan:

1. Download Wharram Design Book

3. Order Study Plan(s)
4. Estimate local costs and building site
5. Order Build Plans
6. Start building

This is to estimate costs of building: [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZlACW1YKN7q79jGD64-dwVuVp8CSUMsNy4LtVstl2T8/edit?gid=989491544#gid=989491544).

## Dreaming
