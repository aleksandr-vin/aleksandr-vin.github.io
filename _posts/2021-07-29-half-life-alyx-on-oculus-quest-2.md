Finally running Half-Life: Alyx. On Oculus Quest 2 via Virtual Desktop on ShadowPC.

It took 7 months (2 more than it was promisied) to get Shadow activation. The price went 2x (from 15,- to 30,- per month). But the specs are
still beter than you can buy for that money x2-3 years: Xeon E5-2678 v3 2.5GHz (8 cores) with 12GB RAM, 250GB disk running Windows 10
Home. And NVIDIA Quadro P5000.

It is my gaming PC now.

First I installed Chrome, Steam, Steam VR, Oculus App and tried playing Youtube videos and Portal 2: pretty good and graphics are very good.

Then I followed these instructions https://arvrtips.com/setup-shadow-pc-with-oculus-quest/#download-steam-stream-vr-and-oculus-home-pc-apps
and tried to go for Shadow App on Oculus, that way it was starting long, laggy and appeared to install some stuff on Shadow PC so
next time you try to launch it from desktop app it first uninstall that "Shadow Alpha" stuff first. So that way Alyx was unplayable and
Steam VR was also very laggy.

Today I checked that my Virtual Desktop App in Oculus is up to day (I got it installed the first day I got my googles, but switched to
ImmersedVR very fast) and followed the second part of the instructions: installed Virtual Desktop Streaming app on Shadow PC, configured
couple of things and voila: rather smooth gameplay in Alyx. It is not completely lag-free, but I'm also streaming Shadow PC on my MacBook
that is on the table with corporate MacBook and all in same wifi... but that I'll check next time. The game is playable, graphics are cool,
pigeons and cats and grass... niiiice. Now I need time to play it.
