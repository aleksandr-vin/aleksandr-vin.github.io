# Users feedback

Notes on [Unity lesson](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-user-feedback?uv=2021.3&pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f7648a4edbc2a5578eb67df#5fabdda8edbc2a2003a571d5).

> Engaging in the user feedback process will also help you develop your skills in scoping, designing, and implementing solutions that address particular user needs.

> ... test early and often! The more you test and refine along the way, the better your end product will be.

> Observe rather than guide
>
> if your testers are struggling with something so basic that they can’t test your product, wait at least 30 seconds, make a note of it and then tell them what to do so you can get more information. On the other hand, if they can work through the problem, their solution will be valuable information for improving your design.

> Don’t explain or justify your design choices
>
> If you gather qualitative feedback — for example, by having a conversation with the tester — again you may be tempted to explain things or justify the current implementation of your project. This can feel good, because it may “fix” the tester’s understanding — but it will not fix what you’re testing!

> Don’t problem-solve during testing
>
> The user insights that come up during testing may immediately send you into problem-solving mode, thinking about how to correct any issues raised. Your tester may also start to focus on this, exploring potential solutions they think of rather than focusing on their experience. 
> It isn’t that these suggestions for solutions don’t have value, but the purpose of the testing session is to gain insights about their experience and to get deep information about their issues.

> Tips and tricks for facilitating
> 
> Here are some useful tips and tricks to support you in facilitating user testing sessions.
> 
> Remind yourself that you are not your product, and every product gets better with feedback — but only if you’re paying attention to what your users are telling you.
>  
> Frame the experience for participants. As each tester comes in, talk with them and explain what a user test is. Emphasize that you want all feedback, and negative feedback can actually be more helpful than positive feedback. Ask them to talk or “narrate” as much as possible while using the product or reviewing the materials, so that you can get a deeper understanding of their thought processes.
> 
> When the testing begins, make sure that you stop talking and record your observations in detail. Things that seem clear in the moment can easily get fuzzy if you only rely on your memory. What does the user struggle with? Is there any feature they’re not using as intended? Are they doing things that don’t seem to make sense?
> 
> If the user stops talking for a while, gently remind them to turn on the interior monologue again, but otherwise pretend you’re behind a one-way mirror.
> 
> If you conduct a conversation with a group of testers, make sure to include them all. Gently prompt quieter testers for their thoughts, to make sure their insights are included.

Summary

> However, to create the best possible real-time experience, it’s important that the product can stand alone.
