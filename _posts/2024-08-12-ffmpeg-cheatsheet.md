Once again openning the door of video encoding. Found this gem to quick and easy explain different use-cases:
[ffmprovisr](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr).

Plus: this workshop would be nice to do: [ffmpeg-artschool](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmpeg-artschool/).

PS. Would be nice to have a tool which for a video file can give you a ffmpeg cli call to convert other video to the same settings.
