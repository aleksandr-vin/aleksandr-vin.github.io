Going next level with audio.

Three years ago I saw a [Travel Sax](https://odiseimusic.com) project which sounded promising. Couple years ago I chipped into
the version 2 on the
[indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/travel-sax-2-reinventing-electronic-saxophones#/updates/all) and last Autumn I
finally got it in my hands. Very impressed with the size and capabilities of the device, and now I can practice even at night!

But playing it with over-the-ear monitors was causing smoe problems, as you can't take off the headphones with only one hand,
while the other hand is holding the device :). That caused me to play it with in-ear headphones, which I had only wired
earpods -- easy to work with, average (that was what I thought that days) with sound quality.

And I decided to get something like Shure SE215. Did some research and almost bought them, but the price of around 135,- EUR
paused me for some time. Until I got a lead from my friend, 
[How In-Ear Monitors are Making Better Musicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHoljbkyAEs) â€” a video where a guy mentioed
a better and cheaper in-ear monitors: [MEE M6 PRO](https://www.meeaudio.com/EP-M6PROG2/), for 50,- USD.

It took some time to finally get them, as I didn't find them in NL and finally ordered from US, that raised price with shipping
and tax costs. But when they came to my place, I was enjoying the sound range, playing around with Logic for the whole evening.

One thing I did wrong, was not buying two of them: I decided to get a bluetooth module from MEE to be used for sport and
commutes, but when I saw that I need to change wires to bluetooth everytime, I started doubting if I'll break them at the end.
