See [preparation post](/2022/08/22/24-hours-sail-race-preparation.html) for the intro.

We were lucky with the weather: there were just right amount wind and waves. Not tired. Crew of 6 people even allowed me to sleep between
shifts and post-shifts. Trainings made us feel confident in tacking. We decided not to abuse spinnaker this time.

Start surprisingly was "gentelmen's": no flags' procedure, just horn ðŸ™‚.

Night part of the race was calm with its' own romance, but without the Moon. We experienced no crowds neither on legs nor at marks in
area between SPORT-D and EZ D. We were adjusting our route on the go, especially when the wind changed easterly at late midnight.

We made a good two laps KG â€“ EZ C â€“ EZ D â€“ KG. But waited too long to go to northern IJsselmeer, came to the shore at SB 28 â€“ SB 18 â€“
SB 28 and lost time there. Then checked into the gig at SB 8, almost touched it after rather early tack â€“ our big fender could almost fit
in between, but we had no time to untie it. At the final we took a chance to make a run WV 19 â€“ KR A â€“ WV 19, thanks to that we came to
final WV 19 mark the most leeward on same tack: squeezed into the mark compacting 3 boats from windward against their will â€“ it's a pity
that nobody from our crew was filming it. On the photo we are under number 155, and lemsterak flew right after us and made from the wind
in a split sec after the mark (you can see it at his mast).

Then we had long run to the finish line under the butterfly (or melk meijse in Dutch) in front and "mizzen" made of part of the crew,
standing wide on the back. We came 8 min before penalty time. Result: 23:51, 28 marks, 151 NM by track, 123.7 NM by legs.

On reaching courses of the last 1/4 of the race there were a bit more of mainsail than needed, but we did not take reefs, that's why
we had to workout at the helm, constantly breaking Berta with the rudder and not allowing her to go into the wind. Giving some slack to
mainsheet didn't help.

We were amazed of warmness and careness at Medemblik, plus that was a first time we saw 7 boats tied up side-to-side so it was possible to
walk through them from the harbor master house to the meldstijger!
