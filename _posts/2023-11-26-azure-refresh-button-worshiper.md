Last time, while making notes about Azure Portal, I've made a joke:

> You just worship the cult of _Refresh button_ --- be my guest, hit it everywhere you see it, if you're waiting for something from MSFT.
> (There should be a browser plugin with customizable intervals per every _refresh_ button to be pressed on that portal --- just kidding,
> there should be no custom intervals, that extension should just hit-that-button automatically or it would be from MSFT too).

Then I've checked and there was no such browser extension. And literally, while I was waiting for the experiments runs and endpoints
deployments on Azure, I've made an MVP of such Safari Extension myself:

It waits 10s after you stop moving mouse or typing keyboard, then clicks on **Refresh** button on the page. Only on `https://*.azure.com/*`.

[Install extension from App Store (TBD)](https://aleksandr.vin/a-link-to-app-store)

It is fun project and was a *learning-while-doing*.

## Name

Originally I called it **Azure Refresh Button Worshiper** but Apple found it a copycat and rejected the name. So it is renamed to
**Cerulean Refresh Button Worshiper** --- "love" it!

## Pricing

Cerulean Refresh Button Worshiper is available for $0.99 on the App Store, with no
in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking. Itâ€™s universal so you can use it on
iPhone, iPad, and Mac. I hope you find it useful.
