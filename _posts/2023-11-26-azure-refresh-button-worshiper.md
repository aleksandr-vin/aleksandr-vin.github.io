title: "(Azure) Refresh Button Worshiper, Browser Extension"

Last time, while making notes about Azure Portal, I've made a joke:

> You just worship the cult of _Refresh button_ --- be my guest, hit it everywhere you see it, if you're waiting for something from MSFT.
> (There should be a browser plugin with customizable intervals per every _refresh_ button to be pressed on that portal --- just kidding,
> there should be no custom intervals, that extension should just hit-that-button automatically or it would be from MSFT too).

Then I've checked and there was no such browser extension. And literally, while I was waiting for the experiments runs and endpoints
deployments on Azure, I've made an MVP of such Safari Extension myself:

It waits 10s after you stop moving mouse or typing keyboard, then clicks on **Refresh** button on the page. Only on `https://*.azure.com/*`.

It is fun project and was a *learning-while-doing*.

## Name

Originally I called it **Azure Refresh Button Worshiper** but Apple found it a copycat and rejected the name. So it is renamed to
**Refresh Button Worshiper** --- I liek it more, but I see a bit more hussle to market it without "Azure" in the name. Plus now it calls
for a generic application: and I think I'll pause it for a bit, until I find something similarly annoying as Refresh buttons on Azure.

## Pricing

Refresh Button Worshiper is available for $0.99 on the App Store, with no
in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking. Itâ€™s universal so you can use it on
iPhone, iPad, and Mac. I hope you find it useful. It is also available for free
on Chrome Web Store (if you're interested why there for free -- send me an email)
and obviously you can compile the Apple app yourself from the codebase.
