Did first lesson on freediving today. Didn't do eLearning before the lesson and was completely out of my mind
when packing for the lesson: took kids swimming shirt by mistake and forgot to take slippers and a towel. But
did surprise everyone. First attempt was till an urge to breath: 1.27. Second was a 2:34 -- instructor did
support me on last seconds by talking to me and asking to do some things. And for the third attempt I had a
plan: to visualize how I'm entering my house, going upstairs by stairs. And it worked: I heared instructor
talking but didn't listen (I've asked him to support me with talking about something), and I was busy with going
upstairs. I was very slow and it took time to concentrate on stepping up the stairs. When I reached 1st floor,
I started going to the 2nd. I think around that time I was already fighting with the urge to breath. But I kept
answering to buddy (instructor) taps, while going upstairs step-by-step. Reaching 2nd floor I was already cramping
and shaking but was seeing it as *under control* -- I do believe in ABC Dive crew. If I recall it now right,
I had my eye balls rolling, while eyes closed, my chest and shoulders pulsing, but my right pointing finger was
raising everytime I feel the tap on my back. Later instructor said that when I was convulsing, my finger was not
such direct as at the beginning, quite opposite to what I was feeling at the time. So, again -- if I remember
it right -- I was able to go down both floors and eventually raised from the water and started rehab. breathing.
That was the moment I felt hard, probably because I was turning on my feelings and other systems. I did more
than 3 *HO-PE* breaths (fast breath in, mouth close and breath out), felt a little bit disorienting, caught some
water, took my mask off and caughed. Both instructors and second cursist were surprised and asking me WTF
was I doing. It was 4:32.

And I really enjoyed it!
