Couple of weeks ago I've bought 2 broken fpv kits from EMAX for my Tinyhawk spare parts. They came with radios, lipos and goggles. Since
I already have one fpv kit from Betafpv in a better shape, I've put them on a shelf. But last Friday I opened one of the goggles and
took off pcb and screen.

I wanted to make a screen for spotter or others on the site, to let them see what I'm flying.

The only mods I did was desoldering the power plug and soldering a on/off button (which I've found in my stash).

Two nights I've spend in OpenSCAD designing the case, check repo here: [emax-analog-screen-case](https://github.com/aleksandr-vin/emax-analog-screen-case).

But since it is too hot last days (28ยบ) or I didn't print for long -- my bed levelling or temperature for ABS is wrong, the print is popping
off the bed and I was stuck without the case.

But I have a 3d gun (it's from my daughters childhood, but anyway it works good), so I decided to fake it till I have 3d printer fixed.

And here are the photos:
