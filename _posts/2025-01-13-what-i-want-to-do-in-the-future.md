January is a good time for new year's resolutions. I decided to write it down for myself.
Not for the upcoming year, but for the years to come.

I want to be sailing around the World on my sailboat and dive searching for old sunk ships,
for their treasures and history. With my girl.

Let's that dream come true!!!
