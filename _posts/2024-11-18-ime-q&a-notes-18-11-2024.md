Reed geek: [https://www.reedgeek.com/why-reedgeek/](https://www.reedgeek.com/why-reedgeek/).
Take an old reed to experiment on.


## Practicing:

**Tone:** with each scale do 1% more relaxed

Posture, relaxing and relaxed breaths

1-finger breathing exercises

Moving longtones (?)

with drones: try also 2nd, 4th, -- don't do it on low range (why?)
+ overtone exercise

**Tech:** scales try on 3/4, 5/4 next day keep it slow
And hear subdivisions (not put them on metronome)

HSAP -- Hear Sing Air Play

Skip the signing for Eastman #1.
And more relaxed!

With transcribing: I don't take a pause to hear it in my head before signing

Listen to the entire melody and ask questions!

Then go one phrase at a time, NOT ONE NOTE!

-----

Markators (staccato and a mark) -- endings in bebop

-----

E-U exercise: start with E, hold 3 sec, go to U in 10 sec, hold 3 in U, go back to E in 10 sec. (for trumpet players ???)

-----

Hit the CMS stage 1,2,3 -- the connection step! // When you have a big band charts with chords you don't know, hit the CMS stage 2 & 3, the connection step.

------

The best way to build endurance: shorter power practice sessions (and often).
