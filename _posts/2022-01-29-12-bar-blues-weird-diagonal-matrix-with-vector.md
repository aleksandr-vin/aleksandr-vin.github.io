Listening & watching youtube on 12 bar blues, first [how to keep the count](https://youtu.be/qjCblIQabfc) and,
then while practicing it and watching on 3 lines by four measures I started seeing that first 3x3 is a diagonal
matrix that is "horizontally mirrored". And the last measure of each line is a vector. Is it a hidden MxA math?
