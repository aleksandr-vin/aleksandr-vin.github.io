After last Friday's freediving training, where I was sharing the whole
pool with a friend, I stumbled upon a TED talk by Sylvia Earle: [My wish: Protect our oceans](https://www.ted.com/talks/sylvia_earle_my_wish_protect_our_oceans). And then, somehow watched
_Seaspiracy_.

Next day I'm picking up _Food choice and Sustainability_ by Richard Oppenlander. And Sunday night I am watching _Forks over Knives_.

Now I'm off the fish and I'am going to avoid animals' based and highly processed food for two reasons:

1. I didn't like how fishing is done and what is the cost for the oceans.
2. I don't want to eat processed food which is made to be a drug and
   harm my body.

Will see.

PS. I'm now in search for tasty recipes to replace old habbits.
