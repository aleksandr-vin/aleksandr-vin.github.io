The course I've enrolled yesterday is
[The Quantum Internet and Quantum Computers: How Will They Change the World?](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:DelftX+QTM1x+2T2022/home) -- DelftX QTM1x at edX.

I've made that after watching a 1 hour webinar yesterday.

I'm through the *Welcome* module still, spent this morning watching TEDx talks links from the course teacher's bios.
Who are:
- Stephanie Wehner
- Lieven Vandersypen
- Menno Veldhorst
- Jonas Helsen

## Videos of the morning

### Can we make quantum technology work? | Leo Kouwenhoven

Very good analogy with nature performing calculations (every moment everywhere?).

And about the chemistry: *O<sub>2</sub>* -- the link that's an electron in
superposition, at both *O* at the same time.

Nice example with the maze path's search. But if you say measuring electrons that
are in superposition, will make them just normal electrons -- how do we read the
result of the computation on QC? Do we need to fill in a new electron that is in
superposition for next computation?

But then, if every electron can become in 2 places simultaneously, why
nothing was said that it can be in 3, 4,... N places simultaneously too?
Why limiting only with 0 and 1 if it can be 0 and 1 and 2 and ... and N?

Can we entangle 3 electrons instead of 2? 4.. 5... more?

### Quantum computers - a revolution in the making | Shai Machness

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="eVjMq7HlwCc" %}

That talk left more questions to the way he told the story: many times I felt
like he's not telling something deliberately. Maybe because I didn't know some
basics in the field. Like if you say when you measure the electron, then
superposition collapses and he becomes a common elelctron which is 0 or 1, but
then you say if we measure the entangled electrons (which are far from each
other), we get the same identical results, but then their superposition is
collapsed, but we try to avoid that? Or each of the entangled electrons if
kept ultracold are in superposition while we move them far away, then we keep
them in superposition until we **want** to measure them, and then we do
measure them and see which state they are and as they are entangled, then
the measurement will give us identical results?

Good that he listed practical applications.

### The Quantum Internet | Stephanie Wehner | TEDxVienna

Damn, she tells the story good. But, hell, leaving you with so many questions at
the end:
- entanglement routing -- which of the electrons that were not transmitted
  originally become master and which one become "transmitted" through router?
- is it possible to phisically move one of the entangled electrons? If yes, then
  it is possible to initialize a "link" at one place and then move to another
  side of the planet by plane.

### Hacking Nature | Stephanie Wehner | TEDxDelftSalon

Real hacker there!
