## I made it. Again. After, maybe, 10 years.

And again I have the same mood here, I think. I'm home alone, listening to
blues.


## Here is a link to a note I made last evening about

[resizing ext4 partition of a guest Ubuntu on vmdk on ESXi 6.0](https://superuser.com/a/1594385/1230369).

I spent some time finding out how to atually resize the disk and wrote down
the steps to remember, and now I have mine **aleksandr.vin**
domain name and a site running on github pages.


## Thoughts about VR (home) office

Last Friday my colleague told me about Oculus Quest 2. Checking the specs,
I had the same feeling when was reading about DJI Mavic Air 2&#x2026; after not
following any updates on DJI for a 2 years. As the VR headset become much
more powerful and much less heavy, I returned to old idea of using VR headset
as a replacement for home office monitor(s) for coding. It should be ok to
have 2K per eye on resolution, but the questions are:

-   Will it be warm to work?

-   Will it be ok to work for 1 hour before the break (also maintaining
    regular breaks should become a habbit)?

-   Eyes strain and degradation?

So I'm thiking about giving it a try in upcoming months.
