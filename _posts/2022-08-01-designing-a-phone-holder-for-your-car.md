Having the magnetic holder before, I need another solution once I went into
[Quad Lock](https://www.quadlockcase.eu) for the bike.

Getting the measurement was easy. Maybe not that easy concerning my sizes, but doable.
Then it took some time to think about the rigging around the screen, and I came to idea
of a clamp that could use the stiffness of a PLA to keep in place and still be easy to
put on and off.

So it took 5 versions of printing and breaking/adjusting it. Current version sits well,
but already need an improvement, the one I can workaround for now :)
