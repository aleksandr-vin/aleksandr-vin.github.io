Use "E" syllable to sing in head when playing on sax: not "DA" but "DEE"

Hearing: hear the resting tone

Listen to the Monk piano version (of Blue Monk) to hear that deep dive interval

What is slurring?

Taking more mouthpiece allows reed to vibrate more -> bigger sound

Rabbit exercise -- check the tone bonus section
