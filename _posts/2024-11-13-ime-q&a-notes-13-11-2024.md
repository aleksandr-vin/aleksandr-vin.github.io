Signed-up for Improvisation Made Easy, course by Donna Schwartz.
I want to develop discipline in practice sessions, train ears and own chords to be able to improv freely and not sound boring.


## Will make notes here.

Warmup:
- Check 'using drones' 
- Slure the whole thing

CORE stage 1 less >> prep >> record video of improvising.

Shorter practice sessions BUT more often!
