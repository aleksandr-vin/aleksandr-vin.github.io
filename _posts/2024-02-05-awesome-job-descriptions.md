I am searching for a new job now, market is difficult, following the lay-offs from the last year and beginning of this one.

One thing I've noticed, is that
all of the job descriptions are written in very different styles/forms/structures. And that eats time, when you need to sieve through a lot of them. It does
not look like one standard will fit, every searcher is different and in different situation, which make them focus on different aspects at the moment. Plus you
focus on different aspects if it is a job in a known company or a completely unknown one.

One day I've stumbled upon a short post in LN, where a guy asked recruiters to stop writing long-reads started with _how good the company is and how happy
you would be if working for it_ and just make a condensed _responsibilities_, _tasks_, _requirements_ + _compensation_, and then follow it with the company
overview. He immetiately got response from peer recruiters asking fellow applicants to stop sending long CVs (many are ai-generated crap, nowadays). Anyway the
problem exists.

And the problem can have a solution. At least for me now. Or how I see it could be working for me:

1. I can get used to processing a topic, where messages follow a schema, which does not change frequently
2. I can adjust the schema to put specific sections into my focus
3. GPT-4 can be used to translate freeform JD into desired structure
4. I can copy-n-paste JD into textarea on a awesome-jd.com site, or I can setup a shortcut to open current page's link via awesome-jd.com (same as 12ft.io)
5. I can setup highlighting for rates, requirements matching and not matching my skills (loaded from my CV or LN), plus GPT-4 can hghlight problematic or
   rare requirements

Some extras from a _one place, where all JDs go though_:

1. Could be worth providing application tracking service there, as they are allready collected, you can add metadata, like _lead contact_, _next action_,
   etc. and then have a table with all the applications, time-tracking and analytics
2. Can generate a template for a motivation letter, which will have my skills spliced with the requirements of the position

Features, which can be added later:

1. Service for recruiters, they can post jobs on awesome-jd.com, filling provided generic schema, which will be rendered differently for job seekers, depending
   on their custom profiles (still all the description will be available, they just have a differnet POV)
2. Analytics of the job market from job seekers POV: how priorities differ for different levels, fields and technologies, maybe locations, etc.

These are some materialized thoughts around the topic of hard-to-work-with job descriptions.
