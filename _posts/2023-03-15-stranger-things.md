Watched 3 seasons with my daughter in one streak. Yesterday night started season 4. Damn, I was swang back into nostalgy,
even though I was not playing Atari at my time. But I do like that series and the vibe.

*/me sighs*

Want to go more into 4th season, but very afraid of that feeling, that will come when it ends. Everytime same feeling when
you finish a good book.
