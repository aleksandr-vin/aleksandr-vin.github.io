The idea was to make a 3D model of the OCC (big) space and see current vs new design of the big screens wall in VR.

As a preparation I've made couple of videos on site and a photo of 1st floor plan at the coffee machine. Then during the
Hackweek I've rushed through the [video course at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-blender-3d-modeling-for-unity-video-game-development/)
and was able to create 2 floors of the OCC building in Blender.

Here how it looks like inside:

![OCC view](/img/klmbcg.jpg){: width="100%" }

Or on youtube (check from 49 second):

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ZiQdH-Jp6MM" %}

And this is how the model in Blender looks like:

Last day was quickly stitching Unity with Oculus Quest 2 and added controller's input to move, change designs and rotate the Sun.

Pretty nice experience!
