In late June, we talked about going to [24 uurs zeilrace](https://24uurszeilrace.nl/). In late July, we registered Berta,
a Halberg-Rassy 36 155, in the race. We are now 6 people with some sail experience.

Boats are racing for the miles among scattered marks in IJsselmeer, Waddenzee and Markermeer.
Starting on Friday evening and finishing in 24 hours.

## Preparations

After registration we decided to have at least 2 trainings with night sailing, and with spinnaker.

Last Friday we've got a package with vimpels and numbers:

## First training

Was held on 12-13 August with a half of our crew. Max and I skipped due to vacations with
families.

## Second training

It was last weekend, 19-20 August. I took Olka, with me, as she were thinking about joining
the race after summer camp on Shtandard.

We had a long discussion ashore about the plan of that training.
As we lack briefing it during the workdays before, everybody had different ideas.
For example I was planning to spend full night of practicing tacks, start procedure and
passing the locks (mostly hoisting and unhoisting sails and starting stopping engine at
specific line). But the guys voted for going to sleep around 0100 or 0200.

We also raised concerns about starting from Hoorn: dry weeks and growth of water plants
plus moving the boat to Hoorn before Friday could be tricky.

Discussions were transferred to the sea and we ended up training some start simulations
at SPORT-C yellow bouy.

I think around 0030 we were back in Pekelharinghaven, drinking beer and talking. And by 0100
we went to sleep with a plan to leave by 0830. Which was not going to happen.

We left around 1100, after trying spinnaker, which we borrowed from Hougaida.

At sea we hoisted spinnaker right after hoisting the mainsail, but we put tack corner
right into the spinnaker pole fitting and didn't have a down-haul. That appeared to be
a mistake which let us broke a spinnaker pole's fitting as a result.

But we still had some fun running under the colors!

During 3 hours of Saturday sailing we did a lot of tacks and got some nice timing in it:
we ended up keeping 2.6kts after tacking at 5.6kts.

Also did practice _braking_: by giving slack to boom-sheet while luffing up to loose 2-3kts and then bearing away back to the course.

Here is a <a href="https://boating.page.link/PFGYSuHteUce1fC39" target="_blank">track</a> after unhoisting spinnaker:

The type of spinnaker pole that Berta had appeared to be old and uncommon nowdays,
so spare parts were impossible to find. But Luba used the magic word _race_ and a
new old pole 4.2m long (slightly longer than damaged one but a proper size for Berta)
appeared, raising race budget with 300EUR more.

Now we have last working week before the race. We plan to have 3 video-calls to discuss
our propoer course, racing rules and final points.

Lazily we look into proper spinnaker rigging, like [https://waypointamsterdam.nl/spinnaker/](https://waypointamsterdam.nl/spinnaker/) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL3QzQusquE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL3QzQusquE) for ex.

And I'm studying _Racing Rules of Sailing_:
