From last ABN fun event: support ad-hoc organising of ticket swap to make groups.

I'm collecting ideas on the ground of "organisation of events". Problems that arise
when you want to organize something, like a week-long boat trip with different people,
or a diving week in Egypt with a club, or team outing, or when you appear on an event
with friends and organizers missed some organizational parts.

## A little bit more in details

### Week-long sailboat trip

If you're a captain of the ship and you need to collect your crew in a distant city
(in Stokholm) at particular (part of the) day. And they all come from different places.
But some can intersect and maybe give a lift. It would be nice to have a trip planner
site/app where you register everyone and then keep the plan, so everyone stay informed
on changes and delays. They can register their flights and trains and even share car
tracks and ETAs. There you can plan meals with coulinary choices/allergies.

### Diving week with club

For the second year I'm suffering from filling-in different sparce PDF files, which are
provided in different times over 3 months (from December to March). They are also in
Dutch and the checklist is made in a word with messed-up list indentations, making it
event more painful. It would be nice to have a site where an even organizer make a
plan what documents and in what times must be collected and then register all attendies
so they see their personal completion progress and description per each step what
needs to be uploaded, what form needs to be downloaded and filled in an uploaded back.
And then such site can compile one PDF with results and give a download link to the
organizer, etc. Plus he can follow the progress of all the members and nag them via
different means, like emails, whatsapp, etc.

### Messed up events

Actually the origins of this post are the ABN fun day event, where organizers made
ad-hoc registration for go-karts (and lazer tag) in two queues, where you'll get your
anonymous ticket with a run time. That ended up with different teams and colleagues
being placed in different run times, lowering the fun as you race with 10 people you
don't know and you don't have fun on the track or in the shooting. It would be nice
to have a simple site that allows you to register your ticket (your name and time)
and make a named group where you want to collect your friends. Then you share the link
to this event across as many people around you as you can, if they register too and
make their groups or join to the groups of their friends, then all these users can see
in realtime with whom they need to swap tickets to complete the puzzle and have fun
with their friends.

### Yachts assignments

And the last one (I think): imagine a local sailing comunity that parties 2 times a year
for "openning" and "(not) closing" the navigation season. They register for the event
and organizer will rent sailboats upfront according the increasing amount of registrations.
Then last week he sits down at the table and starts completing the puzzle: some people
can be a captain, some can be a competent crew, some would like to practice as a captain
but they ask for a skilled captain to be in the crew just for the peace of mind, some
ask not to appear with small kids, some have allergies for dogs, etc...

That organizer was already asking us to design a service or an app to help him do the
assignments (see [this](/2023/09/14/state-in-da-url.html)), and I made a good PoC for it
2 years ago [https://github.com/polvetra-rnd/consatisfaction](https://github.com/polvetra-rnd/consatisfaction).
But it had only one real-life test and didn't succeed (due to faulty input data, IMHO).
So it could be revised and made as a service (see [https://github.com/aleksandr-vin/polvetra.club](https://github.com/aleksandr-vin/polvetra.club)).
