What's it for you in your life?

Since beginning of August I got locked on a mechanical wrist watch. As a message of disgrace towards the smartwatches, smartphones and third-party apps running on my computers.

How so? Being a computer geek all my life I am loosing fate in them. But thinking deeper over that, I think
better would be to say I'm loosing fate in people programming them. Not excluding myself.

I would not brag over the LLMs and all the "AI" things happenning in recent years. Talking in general about
computer programms that are here to help people: are they?

You can say — "If it does the job, it's good enough". I disagree: *consumerism* is already leaving piles of
crap at places of the "least concerned". Places where beneficiars are not living. Places where their sellers
are not living. Places where those who are living, will get that crap and nothing more.

So apps are everywhere now in our lives. And they are mostly crap. Name it.

Spotify — now playing, while I'm
typing it. Just a few seconds ago it skipped a song midair like nothing happened. It's discovery playlists
are useless, I feel hopeless everytime I try them. "Best (something)" playlists are even worser: I hop-off
after I exercise the "skip" button for almost a minute, not even being able to listen for some decent time
for a song. Should it be matching my music taste or pumping me with some algorithmic one's?

Proton Mail — (maybe you didn't even hear of that one) — recent update changed the UX of the archive action,
the most-used one, and it feels like a hiccup now when you slide email left.

Guardian App — with heir cursed limit of 30 topics you can follow: I've developed that number to almost 50
when suddenly it stopped working and asked me to decrease my choices until I can add new. It is very
frustrating to try to find out what is the limit when you stay at 49 and, you remove more and it still says
you are above the number, but what number it does not bother mentioning. Later they fixed that by mentioning
the limit is 30. Still lame.

Calendar iOS — knows better how to add new event's info than you: even when you've already added the date and
time and then picked up a similar-called event from a drop-down list, it replaces you entries with the time
of the event you selected **for the f#cking name**!

Oceanic dive app for iOS — these motherf#ckers managed to release a new version last year that crashed on iOS
17 while still being listed as min required in App Store. There is nothing more upsetting than a crashing
dving app on your wrist, when you're already in a wetsuite in a water set for the dive. Consumer smartwatch
from the company with zero experience in diving and an app from the company with zero experience in a app
development.

Quick (GoPro) — search the internet, it's a PITA to use it, don't want to talk about it more.

Instagram, Facebook — I deleted them at the very beginning of the year and do not miss at all. Could be the
ones professionaly built, but you know what — they somehow decided they know better what their users need.
Trivial things, they all "do the job" for them: feeding me with their POV of news and posts, algorithms
and moderation rules.

Strava, Garmin, Suunto... all busy with their cash flow and not the customers. Check the recent Strava suite
over Garmin. Poor Strava was asked to attribute the data uploaded from Garmin devices and they call it a
"user's data" but they did decide themselves what is better for the user when they restricted their API use a
year ago.

I can continue the list. But if we go to the professional development, it's the same: opinionated choices
can be good. Can be bad. I meet the bad choices too often. Maybe I just notice the bad things...

So if you can program, do yourself a favor: write programs for yourself.

PS. I wear a mechanical watch on my wrist now and it reminds me that there are good things in life that
run no shit and that are completely yours once you bought them. Good luck.
