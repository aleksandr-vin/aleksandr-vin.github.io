I'm still eating vegan, considering WFPB a next level, after I am comfy with vegan.

Made blood tests on 2nd of May, going to track them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gc9PtukQldipdL-miAz3N4Qi_g5f7o_8xaC2xbijPaY/edit?gid=0#gid=0). And stuck a glucose sensor to my arm, gonna last for 2 weeks and monitor
live my glucose in blood. For 2 days it is within avg. 5.2 â€“ 7.1 during the day.

Also tracking my blood pressure and heart rate in the morning + weight. Passed 100 kilo this very morning.

Feeling good.
