Do I have a creativity crysis?

Last week I've finished with two options:
- Learning WebAssembly with some practice at work's project
- Adding WebXR view, again to the work's project

And I decided that I'll choose on Monady which direction to take.

On Monday it didn't work out: I was subconciously avoiding any of these directions
(also having a bad experience on Sunday added to that, I believe). Then I thought
that Unity learning process was making me very energetic and so I'd pick it up
where I left it (two years ago, AFAIR) and just roll on till the end of the week,
and will see what will happen. Then, I stumbled into a [Clarkesworld](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com)'s
discord discussion arouaboutnd **ChatGPT and education** and took some [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oNaCBDNXCwVfrb8ekWxhiTHvxH-qoTAyfw9LiIiovQA/mobilepresent?slide=id.g11084917917_0_128)
to read. Then, I decided to write down notes in a mind map, and tried to use Figma for that.
I noticed that 2D space could be a limiting factor for mind maps and doing that in VR could be
a better thing. So maybe take Babylon.js and WebXR and make my own mind mapping tool.
Even came oldschool and took some design notes with pen and paper. I did open [Unity learning site](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/lesson-3-1-jump-force?uv=2021.3&pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af&missionId=5f7648a4edbc2a5578eb67df&projectId=5cf9639bedbc2a2b1fe1e848#) but didn't restart it yet.

Shit.
