Starting March 2025 with openwater swim for 7mm wetsuit test.

Water temp: 6C.

Plan was to go into the water, try moving around and perform swim in different styles to see how
the restrict are moves in 7mm and stay in the water no longer than 10 min.

All the areas covered by wetsuit are warm and dry, except some areas around the ears, where water
did pass in. Then a little bit of cold was in the feet fingers, where I had windsurf 2-3mm boots.
Then face, I think I can submerge it for longer and deal with the cold on face and forehead. But
the hands, without gloves were freezing underwater: 2-3 strokes and I need to bring them out of the water.

Anyway I'm very glad with the results and with my new pak. Thinking about trying the windsurf 3mm
next time.

Then Suunto App and Polar Flow both uploaded activities to TrainingPeaks, where I downloaded both
FIT files and reuploaded to the activity starting with polar to let TP to use it's HR data
(Suunto Ocean also tried recording HR data, I don't know how, but it was off and with abruptions).
