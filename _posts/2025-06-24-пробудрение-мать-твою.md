# _"Пробудрение", мать твою!_

_“The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity”_, by Alan Cooper.

Read the book first.

Reading news today, I stepped over a word _wokeness_ -- the definition of which I decided to check (sometimes I go to thesaurus, sometimes, when I'm lazy
-- directly to translation). I got a strange word, that didn't sound right (I'm a native russian speaker, but not proficient in literature, but still).
And quick googling of it did show I've found a **rare** one!

![translation](/img/пробудрение-2.PNG){: width="50%" }

Jokes aside, AFAICS this is the word we are making right now in the software (I'm proficient in software development): we go for more **features** and rarely spend time
to increase the **quality** of the feature.

This example with Apple Translator app is showing the use LLM. It comes up with the right translation for words in 99% (my quick guess) cases, but when it does not, it gives you a hallicinated one. Hail to the generation which is coming this way! Those who will use such translators will build "poisoned" vocabularies as they may not
spot such rare stupid AI-generated words, which they should throw away.

That's why that book of Alan Cooper came to my mind and that's why it's a PITA for an experienced software dev to use a website or an app which is published but is of
substandard quality. There is a special place in Hell for their developers, I truly believe so.

Another example of craze-stupid-life is the description photos for a LED light bulb I was searching in online aggregator a day ago. This is a F! ligth bulb, how one can mess up the description of it? Only through **careless automation**. Check yourself:

![light bulb shop photos](/img/light-bulb-messed-online-photos.gif){: width="50%" }

Probably the prompt for the LLM there would be:

```
... give 5 pictures for the product, showing the product itself, energy label, and scheme ...
```

So the description **looks like a description** but is (1) useless and (2) confusing:

- What energy rating it has eventually?
- What are the dimensions of the bulb?
- Do energy rating differ in Greece?
- Why two bulbs are there, but differet in tint?

Anyone knows that address in Hell, please share!
