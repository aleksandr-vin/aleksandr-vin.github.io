  I made it. Again. After, maybe, 10 years.

  And again I have the same mood here, I think. I'm home alone, listening blues.

  Here is a link to a note I made last evening about
  [[https://superuser.com/a/1594385/1230369][resizing ext4 partition of a guest Ubuntu on vmdk on ESXi 6.0]].
  I spent some time finding out how to atually resize the disk and wrote down
  the steps to remember, and now I have mine *aleksandr.vin*
  domain name and a site running on github pages.
