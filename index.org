* So many things to learn [2020-12-04]

  I was not making any records for almost 2 months. Will do that now.

** Progress on VideoParking

   There was quite some progress on the VideoParking.live project:

    + We have now a Raspberry PIs with cameras, at 2 (almost 3)
      locations, that upload a photo every minute to S3

    + There is a Lambda triggered by such uploads, that produces zones
      picture (initially it was producing a zip file with each zone as
      a separarte jpg file, but it showed that running detection on a
      file has a constant time and it's around 45 seconds on home
      server, so no zones are just masked on one jpg) and uploads it
      to different S3 bucket
    
    + Then there is a detector processes, running in k8s, sharded,
      which fetches zones file for its locations every minute,
      performs detections and registers results to Timestream

    + On the page, react app is fetching data (location stats per
      zone, raw image, and detections) and drawing everything on a
      canvas.

   Plan is to show only stats on a map and add authorization for
   billing and operators' features (raw image and all detections data).

** And now, all the things to learn:

   + *react-leaflet*: to display zones and parking status, show
     current location, find locations in the area, cluster zones.

   + *react-leaflet-draw*: to draw zones on the map easily.

   + Prometheus and Grafana for k8s cluster: to collect metrics from
     services.

   + Drawing on canvas in React App: to ease zones
     corrections/creation on raw image.

   + Authentication for React app and Lambda functions.

   + YOLO3 detector: how to train it on for cars only and to detect
     cars from the top view angle.

   + Running detector in EKS and probably on GKS, AKS to compare.

   + Enabling GPU support on local k8s cluster and using image with
     GPU in cloud.

** VendÃ©e Globe, RYA courses

   Yeah, the race started at the first part of November. And I
   attended RYA skipper theory courses. Big plans.

   And yesterday made an account in Virtual Regatta, now I'm also
   doing round the globe.

* Sometimes you're forced to use old tools [2020-10-15]

  Somebody's playing in security. You need to use *docker-machine*
  because you can't run native *docker* on localhost /(last [[https://github.com/docker/machine/commit/b170508bf44c3405e079e26d5fdffe35a64c6972][commit]] to
  docker-machine repo on github was made more than a year ago)/. And
  it doesn't work from the box.  So you're tuning it up /(like almost
  everything on Linux)/.

  This time the problem was in names' differences of default shared
  folder (host ~/home~ was mounted as ~/hosthome~ in guest vm, where
  actual docker engine runs), and rather loosy behaviour of ~-v~,
  ~--volume~ option of ~docker run~ in comparison to more explicit
  ~--mount~. See question answer on [[https://superuser.com/a/1594651/1230369][superuser.com]].

* Something to start with [2020-10-15]

** I made it. Again. After, maybe, 10 years.

   And again I have the same mood here, I think. I'm home alone, listening to
   blues.

** Here is a link to a note I made last evening about
   [[https://superuser.com/a/1594385/1230369][resizing ext4 partition of a guest Ubuntu on vmdk on ESXi 6.0]].

   I spent some time finding out how to atually resize the disk and wrote down
   the steps to remember, and now I have mine *aleksandr.vin*
   domain name and a site running on github pages.

** Thoughts about VR (home) office
   
   Last Friday my colleague told me about Oculus Quest 2. Checking the specs,
   I had the same feeling when was reading about DJI Mavic Air 2... after not
   following any updates on DJI for a 2 years. As the VR headset become much
   more powerful and much less heavy, I returned to old idea of using VR headset
   as a replacement for home office monitor(s) for coding. It should be ok to
   have 2K per eye on resolution, but the questions are:

     + Will it be warm to work?

     + Will it be ok to work for 1 hour before the break (also maintaining
       regular breaks should become a habbit)?

     + Eyes strain and degradation?

   So I'm thiking about giving it a try in upcoming months.
